# Welcome to my Project!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. I have created a web-based loot system for
the Dungeons & Dragons 5e Platform. This loot system is designed so that you can quickly and efficiently
hand out coin & other various rewards on a random roll table without needing to do things like:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Plan ahead for reward handouts.</li>
  <li>Dig through your books(or have a hundred sticky notes).</li>
  <li>Rolling + Math which does take up valuable time.</li>
  <li>(if you plan ahead) Roll ahead of time quicky with out system.</li>
</ul>

This has been a very fun first JavaScript project for me so far, and i'm very excited to see where this
project goes. It started out as something i needed to speed up my pre-campaign work as a paid dungeon master.
This quickly turned into me realizing that it could be not only a useful tool for me, but also a really cool
project i could share with others. There are some options for pre-planning and measuring out things but i've yet
to come across one that i liked, which lead me to make my own. As this "loot" website grows, we will most likely
be adding more features than just loot.

If you like my table and find it very useful, Donations through my patreon are very much appreciated:<br>

So you don't even have to download the repo if you are just looking to check out the system itself, and not so much the codes.
